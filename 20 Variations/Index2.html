“You tried to change didn’t you?<br>
closed your mouth more<br>
tried to be softer<br>
prettier<br>
less volatile, less awake<br>
but even when sleeping you could feel<br>
him travelling away from you in his dreams<br>
so what did you want to do love<br>
split his head open?<br>
you can’t make homes out of human beings<br>
someone should have already told you that<br>
and if he wants to leave<br>
then let him leave<br>
you are terrifying<br>
and strange and beautiful<br>
something not everyone knows how to love.” <br>
