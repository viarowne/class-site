“You tried to change didn’t you?<br>
closed your mouth more<br>
tried to be softer<br>
prettier<br>
less volatile, less awake<br>
but even when sleeping you could feel him travelling away from you in his dreams <br>
so what did you want to do love <br>
split his head open? <br>
you can’t make homes out of human beings <br>
someone should have already told you that<br>
and if he wants to leave<br>
then let him leave<br>
you are terrifying<br>
and strange and beautiful something<br>
</p>

<p class="big">
not everyone knows how to love.” <br>
