<h1><p> “You tried to change didn’t you?</p></h1>
<h1><p>closed your mouth more</p></h1>
<h1><p>tried to be softer</p></h1>
<h1><p>prettier</p>
<h1><p>less volatile, less awake</p></h1>
<h1><p>but even when sleeping you could feel</p></h1>
<h1><p>him travelling away from you in his dreams</p></h1>

<h2><p><strong>so what did you want to do love
split his head open?
you can’t make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love.”</strong></p></h2>
